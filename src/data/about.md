# SADID
### Social Analytics by Data for Inclusive Development.

*SADID in Arabic means the righteous insights or answer that is morally right.*

Unemployment, deforestation, low enrolment rate, transport and all the social problems that have negative consequences for large numbers of people, such as issues are usually intertwined with another social problem E.g. unemployment is intertwined with Investment attraction, quality education and formal job creation. One can argue that to solve the former we need to tackle the latter and so on like a snake eating its own tail. It is not as easy as in business where profit can be valid metrics of success. Rarely, if ever, are metrics for social change so clearly defined.
P-Curiosity Lab is launching SADID a collaborative framework to bridge between stakeholders, data holders and data scientists in order to design solutions for boosting social impact.

### Real Data

*“We must convey what constitutes data, what it can be used for, and why it’s valuable.”* 

To affect social change, we must spread the idea beyond technologists that data is more than “spreadsheets” or “indicators.” We must consider any digital information, of any kind, as a potential data source that could yield new information.

We need more opportunities for good old-fashioned conversation between stakeholders and data experts to uncover data science questions or problems to create real impact in the world.

### Communication is king

*“We must foster environments in which people can speak openly, honestly, and without judgment. We must be constantly curious about each other.”*

Socially minded data science competitions or hackathons and fellowship models will continue to thrive, but we must build strong communication through which diverse parties gain a greater understanding of and respect for each other.

### Collective design

We start with the questions before we ever touch the data and strive to use human-centred design to create solutions that we feel confident our partners are going to use before we even begin.
